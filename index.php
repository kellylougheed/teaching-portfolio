	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p>I'm a computer science teacher in Los Angeles, CA with experience teaching all levels of secondary CS, from AP-level Java to 6th grade Scratch. I've also taught Python, C, and web development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. My experience includes integrating computer science with math &amp; humanities and also working as a software developer.</p>

	<p>I am currently earning my M.Ed. in Computer Science Education from the College of St. Scholastica and hold a certificate in Software Development and Programming from UC Berkeley.</p>

	<p>I have also taught Latin and earned my undergraduate degree in Latin &amp; Greek from Brown University.</p>

	<h3>My Teaching</h3>

	<p>I love teaching because it's an opportunity for me to share my interests with young people, whether I'm teaching computer science or ancient languages.</p>

	<p>I believe that school should be collaborative, interactive, and fun, and I strive to incorporate student-centered activities into all my classes.</p>

	<p>This website highlights my teaching work and qualifications as a computer science and a Latin teacher.</p>
