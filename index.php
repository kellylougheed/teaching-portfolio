	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p>I'm a Los Angeles-based computer science teacher with a background in Latin. I've worked as a software developer and am currently in my fourth year of teaching. Before I moved back to my home state, California, I taught in independent schools in Arizona and Florida.</p>

	<p>A Classics (Latin &amp; Greek) graduate of Brown University, I am now pursuing certificates in Software Development at UC Berkeley Extension and Computer Science Education at the College of St. Scholastica.</p>

	<h3>My Teaching</h3>

	<p>I love teaching because it's an opportunity for me to share my passions with young people, whether I'm teaching computer languages or ancient languages.</p>

	<p>I believe that school should be collaborative, interactive, and fun, and I strive to incorporate projects, games, and student-centered activities into all my classes.</p>

	<p>This website displays my teaching work and qualificiations as a computer science and a Latin teacher.</p>
