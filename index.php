	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p>I'm a Los Angeles-based computer science teacher with a background in Latin. I've worked as a software developer and am currently in my fourth year of teaching. I've taught computer science and Latin in independent schools in California, Florida, and Arizona.</p>

	<p>A Classics graduate of Brown University, I will complete certificates in Software Development (UC Berkeley) and Computer Science Education (College of St. Scholastica) in summer 2018.</p>

	<h3>My Teaching</h3>

	<p>I love teaching because it's an opportunity for me to share my passions with young people, whether I'm teaching computer science or ancient languages.</p>

	<p>I believe that school should be collaborative, interactive, and fun, and I strive to incorporate projects, games, and student-centered activities into all my classes.</p>

	<p>This website highlights my teaching work and qualifications as a computer science and a Latin teacher.</p>
