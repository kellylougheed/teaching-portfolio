	<h1>Teaching Portfolio</h1>

	<p>I'm a computer science teacher who will be teaching coding at Wildwood School this fall. I've worked as a software developer and am currently pursuing a graduate certificate in Computer Science Education at the College of St. Scholastica. Now a fourth-year teacher, I started my career teaching Latin at Episcopal School of Jacksonville and Chandler Preparatory Academy. I earned my B.A. in Classics (Latin &amp; Greek) from Brown University.</p>

	<p>I love teaching because it's an opportunity for me to share my passions with young people, whether I'm teaching the language of the Ancient Romans from 2000 years ago or the language of the iPhone from two years ago. I believe that school should be collaborative, interactive, and fun, and I strive to incorporate projects, games, and student-centered activities into my classes.</p>

	<p>This website displays my teaching work and qualificiations as both a computer science and Latin teacher.</p>
