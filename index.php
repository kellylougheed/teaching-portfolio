	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p>I'm a computer science teacher who will be teaching coding at Wildwood School this fall. I've worked as a software developer and am currently pursuing a graduate certificate in Computer Science Education at the College of St. Scholastica.</p>

	<p>Now a fourth-year teacher, I started my career teaching Latin at Episcopal School of Jacksonville and Chandler Preparatory Academy. I earned my B.A. in Classics (Latin &amp; Greek) from Brown University.</p>

	<h3>My Teaching</h3>

	<p>I love teaching because it's an opportunity for me to share my passions with young people, whether I'm teaching computer languages or ancient languages.</p>

	<p>I believe that school should be collaborative, interactive, and fun, and I strive to incorporate projects, games, and student-centered activities into all my classes.</p>

	<p>This website displays my teaching work and qualificiations as a computer science and Latin teacher.</p>
