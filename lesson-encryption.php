	<h1>Encryption Lesson</h1>

	<p>This lesson introduces the concept of algorithms through activities about encryption and security. It was originally delivered to a group of seven students who were assumed to have no background knowledge in computer science.</p>

	<p>In this lesson, students are introduced to encryption and decryption through childhood secret languages they might be familiar with, such as Pig Latin. Then they pretend they are CIA agents who must decrypt a secret code intercepted from criminals, which turns out to be Caesar's Cipher. Finally, the students come up with their own encryption system and write "algorithms" for their classmates to decode their secret messages. In between the activities, the class discusses effective encryption systems and how computer algorithms can help us encrypt and decrypt text.</p>

	<p>The goal of this lesson was to spark student interest about computer science by evoking the mysterious, high-stakes world of cybersecurity. Although cybersecurity and cryptography are complex fields, Caesar's Cipher provides an accessible introduction to core concepts in CS and security.</p>

	<p>Below is my lesson plan.</p>
