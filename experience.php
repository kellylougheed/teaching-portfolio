	<p>In 2017-2018, I taught 6th-8th grade computer science classes using languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, Scratch, and HTML/CSS, integrating activities with art, bots, and VR. A typical class had 20+ students who collaborated with each other using practices such as POGIL and pair programming. In addition to programming, my students also learned about computing history and discussed technology news.</p>

	<p>While at Wildwood, I led a web development workshop at the Innovat.ED LA conference and collaborated with the Tech Department to plan Hour of Code, where I developed a custom upper school lesson using p5.js. I also involved Wildwood in a local hackathon among several LA schools, where I led an Arduino workshop.</p>

	<p>In 2014-2016, I taught Latin I, IB, II, III, and IV to 8th-12th grade students. Each class had 10-15 students. I used games and activities to reinforce learning Latin grammar and vocabulary and collaborated with the other Latin teacher to develop a Roman culture curriculum. I ensured student success on assessments with "practice tests" and did projects on Greek mythology and Roman history, as well as a unit on the film <i>Gladiator</i>. As the JCL (Latin Club) advisor, I provided activities for meetings while encouraging students to take on club responsibilities. In summer 2016, I created academic materials for the school Ancient Italy trip and served as a chaperone.</p>

	<h3>Chandler Preparatory Academy - Latin Teacher</h3>

	<p>In 2013-2014, I taught three sections of 6th grade Latin and one section of 9th grade Latin III Honors at one of the Great Hearts charter schools. Each class had 20-24 students. Through mentorship, I developed classroom management skills and Latin-based games to engage middle school students. I also developed a literature-based curriculum for the second semester of Latin III, selecting Horace and Catullus poems to read by theme. I used group work to maximize student participation and made activities such as "Grammar Treasure Hunts" to reinforce the material.</p>

	<h3>The Paideia Institute - Assistant Teacher</h3>

	<p>In summer 2013, I was an assistant teacher for Living Latin in Rome High School. In addition to chaperoning the students in the dorm and around the city, I led small groups in spoken Latin and translation activities around Rome.</p>
