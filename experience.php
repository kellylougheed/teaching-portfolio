	<h1>Experience</h1>

	<h3>Wildwood School - Coding Teacher</h3>
	<p>I teach middle school coding classes with Python, Scratch, and HTML/CSS. Each class has 20+ students. In addition to building websites and games, my students also learn about computing history and the internet, and they discuss technology news. As the Coding Club advisor, I provide students with resources to learn languages that interest them, such as C++ and C#, and answer their programming questions. In December, I collaborated with the Tech Department to plan Hour of Code, and I developed custom upper school activities with JavaScript (p5.js).</p>

	<h3>Girl Develop It LA - Teaching Assistant</h3>
	<p>While working as a software developer in spring 2017, I volunteered as a teaching assistant for introductory programming classes in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and PHP/MySQL. I assisted with in-class projects, answered questions about programming, and troubleshot technical issues.</p>

	<p>From 2014 to 2016, I taught Latin I, IB, II, III, and IV to 8th-12th grade students. Each class had 10-15 students. I used games and activities to reinforce learning Latin grammar and vocabulary and collaborated with the other Latin teacher to develop a Roman culture curriculum. I ensured student success on assessments with "practice tests" and did projects on Greek mythology and Roman history, as well as a unit on the film <i>Gladiator</i>. As the JCL (Latin Club) advisor, I provided activities for meetings while encouraging students to take on club responsibilities. In summer 2016, I created academic materials for the school Ancient Italy trip and served as a chaperone.</p>

	<h3>Chandler Preparatory Academy - Latin Teacher</h3>
	<p>In the 2013-2014 school year, I taught three sections of 6th grade Latin and one section of 9th grade Latin III Honors at one of the Great Hearts charter schools. Each class had 20-24 students. Through mentorship, I developed classroom management skills and Latin-based games to engage middle school students. I also developed a literature-based curriculum for the second semester of Latin III, selecting Horace and Catullus poems to read by theme. I used group work to maximize student participation and made activities such as "Grammar Treasure Hunts" to reinforce the material.</p>

	<h3>The Paideia Institute - Assistant Teacher</h3>
	<p>In summer 2013, I was an assistant teacher for Living Latin in Rome High School. In addition to chaperoning the students in the dorm and around the city, I led small groups in spoken Latin and translation activities around Rome.</p>
