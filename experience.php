	<h1>Experience</h1>

	<h3>Wildwood School - Computer Science Teacher</h3>
	<p>I teach 6th-8th grade computer science classes using languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, Scratch, and HTML/CSS, integrating activities with art, bots, and VR. A typical class has 20+ students who collaborate with each other using practices such as POGIL and pair programming. In addition to programming, my students also learn about computing history and the internet, and they discuss technology news.</p>

	<p>While at Wildwood, I led a web development workshop at the Innovat.ED LA conference and collaborated with the Tech Department to plan Hour of Code, where I developed a custom upper school lesson using p5.js. I also involved Wildwood in a local hackathon among several LA schools, where I led an Arduino workshop.</p>

	<p>From 2014 to 2016, I taught Latin I, IB, II, III, and IV to 8th-12th grade students. Each class had 10-15 students. I used games and activities to reinforce learning Latin grammar and vocabulary and collaborated with the other Latin teacher to develop a Roman culture curriculum. I ensured student success on assessments with "practice tests" and did projects on Greek mythology and Roman history, as well as a unit on the film <i>Gladiator</i>. As the JCL (Latin Club) advisor, I provided activities for meetings while encouraging students to take on club responsibilities. In summer 2016, I created academic materials for the school Ancient Italy trip and served as a chaperone.</p>

	<h3>Chandler Preparatory Academy - Latin Teacher</h3>
	<p>In the 2013-2014 school year, I taught three sections of 6th grade Latin and one section of 9th grade Latin III Honors at one of the Great Hearts charter schools. Each class had 20-24 students. Through mentorship, I developed classroom management skills and Latin-based games to engage middle school students. I also developed a literature-based curriculum for the second semester of Latin III, selecting Horace and Catullus poems to read by theme. I used group work to maximize student participation and made activities such as "Grammar Treasure Hunts" to reinforce the material.</p>

	<h3>The Paideia Institute - Assistant Teacher</h3>
	<p>In summer 2013, I was an assistant teacher for Living Latin in Rome High School. In addition to chaperoning the students in the dorm and around the city, I led small groups in spoken Latin and translation activities around Rome.</p>
