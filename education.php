	<h1>Education</h1>

	<h3>Computer Science</h3>
	<h4 class="center">JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Swift, HTML/CSS</h4>

	<p>I've been making websites since 3rd grade and have also worked as a software developer. After completing a web developer internship at OmniUpdate, I accepted a junior developer position at Specialty Medical Drugstore, where I worked primarily with Python and JavaScript. I've completed a variety of coursework and professional development in software.</p>

	<h4>College of St. Scholastica</h4>
	<p>Starting summer 2017, I am pursuing a graduate certificate in Computer Science Education. The coursework covers the curricula of AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles using Java and MIT's App Inventor. The certificate emphasizes pedagogy and diversity.</p>

	<h4>Flatiron School</h4>
	<p>In April-May 2017, I completed a 125-hour online course in iOS app development and Swift and built numerous iPhone applications.</p>

	<h4>University of Texas-Austin</h4>
	<p>In February-March 2017, I earned a certificate in Foundations of Computer Science for Teachers from UT Austin. The course covered core CS concepts such as data structures (linked lists, binary trees, graphs, stacks &amp; queues), searching &amp; sorting algorithms, big O notation, hardware, and networking.</p>

	<h4>Firehose Project</h4>
	<p>From August 2016 - January 2017, I completed an online coding bootcamp which specialized in Ruby on Rails. I built six RoR web applications and worked in a remote agile team to build a RoR chess application. Using Ruby and JavaScript, the coursework also covered data structures, algorithms, and computer science fundamentals such as object-oriented programming, recursion, runtime, binary &amp; hexadecimal numbers, and public key encryption.</p>

	<h4>Stanford University</h4>
	<p>In summer 2007, I completed Stanford's Java-based intro computer science class as an rising high school junior.</p>

	<h3>Latin</h3>

	<p>I studied Latin since 6th grade and earned the Marin-McNamara Scholarship to continue my studies at the college level. I've completed extensive coursework in Latin & Ancient Greek literature, the Italian language, and Roman history, art, and archaeology.</p>

	<h4>Brown University</h4>
	<p>In May 2013, I earned my B.A. in Classics (Latin & Greek) magna cum laude. While at Brown, I led the Classics Department Undergraduate Group and promoted Classics with a number of new activities, such as a field trip to the MFA, an inscription walk, a graduate student panel, and a celebration of the Ides of March. I was awarded the Workman-Driscoll Premium for my service to the department. My honors thesis on the Tomb of Caecilia Metella combined literature, history, and archaeology and was awarded the James Aldrich Pirce Prize for best thesis on a Roman topic as well as the department's nomination for best thesis in the university.</p>

	<h4>Living Latin in Rome</h4>
	<p>In summer 2012, I participated in the Paideia Institute's Living Latin in Rome program, where I practiced conversational Latin in Rome, Italy. Upon returning to Brown in the fall, I co-founded Spoken Latin at Brown. The Paideia Institute invited me back the following summer as an Assistant Teacher for their high school spoken Latin program.</p>

	<h4>Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies</h4>
	<p>In fall 2011, I studied Roman history and archaeology at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies. While completing coursework in Greek literature and Latin inscriptions, I traveled throughout Italy and Sicily to study the Roman ruins and interned at the American Academy in Rome.</p>
