	<h1>Education</h1>

  <h2>Computer Science</h2>

  <p>I've been making websites since 3rd grade and programming since high school using TI-BASIC and Java. I've also worked as a software developer using languages such as Python and JavaScript and have completed a range of coursework in computer science and CS education.</p>

  <h3>College of St. Scholastica</h3>
  <p>In summer 2018, I will complete my graduate certificate in Computer Science Education before continuing to pursue an M.Ed. My coursework has covered AP Computer Science Principles using App Inventor and the Mobile CSP curriculum, as well as AP Computer Science A using Java. The CS Ed certificate also includes work on computational thinking using Scratch, diversity and inclusion practices, and CS education policy.</p>

  <h3>University of California, Berkeley</h3>
  <p>In spring 2018, I earned my professional certificate in Software Development and Programming. The coursework included programming in Python and C, databases with SQL, electronics, computer architecture, physical computing with the Raspberry Pi, the software development life cycle, networking, and cybersecurity. I also researched internet technologies and the digital divide.</p>

  <h3>Professional Development</h3>
  <p>I regularly complete professional development and online coursework to stay abreast of current technologies used in the industry and the classroom. My PD and online courses have covered topics such as LEGO robotics, Arduino programming, WebVR with A-Frame, p5.js, iOS development with Swift, and the history of technology.</p>

  <h3>Firehose Software Engineering Program</h3>
  <p>While working as a web developer intern in 2016, I completed a six-month online program in full-stack web development. I built six web applications using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS and worked on a remote agile team to build a RoR chess application. Using Ruby and JavaScript, the course also covered data structures and algorithms.</p>

  <h3>Stanford University</h3>
  <p>In summer 2007, I completed Stanford's Java-based intro computer science class, CS106A.</p>

  <h2>Latin</h2>

  <p>I studied Latin starting in 6th grade and earned the Marian McNamara Scholarship to continue my studies at the college level. I've completed extensive coursework in Latin &amp; Ancient Greek literature, the Italian language, and Roman history, art, and archaeology.</p>

  <h3>Brown University</h3>
  <p>In May 2013, I earned my B.A. in Classics (Latin &amp; Greek) magna cum laude. While at Brown, I led the Classics Department Undergraduate Group and promoted Classics with a number of new activities, such as a field trip to the MFA, an inscription walk, a graduate student panel, and a celebration of the Ides of March. I was awarded the Workman-Driscoll Premium for my service to the department. My honors thesis on the Tomb of Caecilia Metella combined literature, history, and archaeology and was awarded the James Aldrich Pirce Prize for best thesis on a Roman topic as well as the department's nomination for best thesis in the university.</p>

  <h3>Living Latin in Rome</h3>
  <p>In summer 2012, I participated in the Paideia Institute's Living Latin in Rome program, where I practiced spoken Latin in Rome, Italy. Upon returning to Brown in the fall, I co-founded Spoken Latin at Brown. The Paideia Institute invited me back the following summer as an Assistant Teacher for their high school spoken Latin program.</p>

  <h3>Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies</h3>
  <p>In fall 2011, I studied Roman history and archaeology at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies. While completing coursework in Greek literature and Latin inscriptions, I traveled throughout Italy and Sicily to study the Roman ruins and interned at the American Academy in Rome.</p>
