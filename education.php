	<h3>Firehose Software Engineering Program</h3>
	<p>In 2016, I completed a six-month course in full-stack web development and computer science fundamentals. I built six web applications using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS and worked on a remote agile team to build a RoR chess application. Using Ruby and JavaScript, the course also covered data structures and algorithms.</p>

	<h3>Stanford University</h3>
	<p>In summer 2007, I completed Stanford's Java-based intro computer science class.</p>

	<h2>Latin</h2>

	<p>I studied Latin starting in 6th grade and earned the Marian McNamara Scholarship to continue my studies at the college level. I've completed extensive coursework in Latin &amp; Ancient Greek literature, the Italian language, and Roman history, art, and archaeology.</p>

	<h3>Brown University</h3>
	<p>In May 2013, I earned my B.A. in Classics (Latin &amp; Greek) magna cum laude. While at Brown, I led the Classics Department Undergraduate Group and promoted Classics with a number of new activities, such as a field trip to the MFA, an inscription walk, a graduate student panel, and a celebration of the Ides of March. I was awarded the Workman-Driscoll Premium for my service to the department. My honors thesis on the Tomb of Caecilia Metella combined literature, history, and archaeology and was awarded the James Aldrich Pirce Prize for best thesis on a Roman topic as well as the department's nomination for best thesis in the university.</p>

	<h3>Living Latin in Rome</h3>
	<p>In summer 2012, I participated in the Paideia Institute's Living Latin in Rome program, where I practiced spoken Latin in Rome, Italy. Upon returning to Brown in the fall, I co-founded Spoken Latin at Brown. The Paideia Institute invited me back the following summer as an Assistant Teacher for their high school spoken Latin program.</p>

	<h3>Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies</h3>
	<p>In fall 2011, I studied Roman history and archaeology at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies. While completing coursework in Greek literature and Latin inscriptions, I traveled throughout Italy and Sicily to study the Roman ruins and interned at the American Academy in Rome.</p>
