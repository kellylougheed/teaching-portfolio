	<h1>Education</h1>

	<h2>Computer Science</h2>
	<h3>JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Swift, HTML/CSS</h3>

	<p>I've been making websites since 3rd grade and have also worked as a software developer. After completing a web developer internship at OmniUpdate, I accepted a developer position at Specialty Medical Drugstore, where I worked primarily with Python and JavaScript. I've completed a variety of coursework and professional development in software.</p>

	<h3>College of St. Scholastica</h3>
	<p>Since summer 2017, I have been pursuing a graduate certificate in Computer Science Education. The coursework covers AP Computer Science Principles using MIT's App Inventor and the Mobile CSP curriculum, as well as the curriculum of AP Computer Science A using Java. The certificate includes work on computational thinking using Scratch, diversity and inclusion practices, and CS education policy.</p>

	<h3>Professional Development</h3>
	<p>I regularly participate in PD and complete online courses to stay up-to-date with the field and expand my computer science knowledge. My PD work includes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li> <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: I am currently completing the NSA's Cyber Teacher Certificate as well as an introductory cybersecurity course through University of Washington on edX. (7/17-Present)</li>
		<li> <strong>Beauty &amp; Joy of Computing</strong>: I completed 60 hours of training in UC Berkeley's Beauty &amp; Joy of Computing curriculum for AP Computer Science Principles, which uses the Snap! programming language. (7/17)</li>
		<li> <strong>Swift: Building iOS Apps</strong>: I completed a 125-hour course in iOS app development and Swift at the Flatiron School. (4/17-5/17)</li>
		<li> <strong>Internet History, Technology, &amp; Security</strong>: I completed a 10-week course on the history, technology, and security of the internet through University of Michigan on Coursera (2/17-4/17).</li>
		<li> <strong>Computer Science Fundamentals for Teachers</strong>: I completed a six-week course on data structures and algorithms through University of Texas-Austin on edX (2/17-3/17).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Firehose Software Engineering Program</h3>
	<p>In 2016, I completed a six-month program in full-stack web development and computer science fundamentals. I built six web applications using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS and worked on a remote agile team to build a RoR chess application. Using Ruby and JavaScript, the course also covered data structures and algorithms.</p>

	<h3>Stanford University</h3>
	<p>In summer 2007, I completed Stanford's Java-based intro computer science class as an rising high school junior.</p>

	<h2>Latin</h2>

	<p>I studied Latin starting in 6th grade and earned the Marian McNamara Scholarship to continue my studies at the college level. I've completed extensive coursework in Latin &amp; Ancient Greek literature, the Italian language, and Roman history, art, and archaeology.</p>

	<h3>Brown University</h3>
	<p>In May 2013, I earned my B.A. in Classics (Latin &amp; Greek) magna cum laude. While at Brown, I led the Classics Department Undergraduate Group and promoted Classics with a number of new activities, such as a field trip to the MFA, an inscription walk, a graduate student panel, and a celebration of the Ides of March. I was awarded the Workman-Driscoll Premium for my service to the department. My honors thesis on the Tomb of Caecilia Metella combined literature, history, and archaeology and was awarded the James Aldrich Pirce Prize for best thesis on a Roman topic as well as the department's nomination for best thesis in the university.</p>

	<h3>Living Latin in Rome</h3>
	<p>In summer 2012, I participated in the Paideia Institute's Living Latin in Rome program, where I practiced spoken Latin in Rome, Italy. Upon returning to Brown in the fall, I co-founded Spoken Latin at Brown. The Paideia Institute invited me back the following summer as an Assistant Teacher for their high school spoken Latin program.</p>

	<h3>Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies</h3>
	<p>In fall 2011, I studied Roman history and archaeology at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies. While completing coursework in Greek literature and Latin inscriptions, I traveled throughout Italy and Sicily to study the Roman ruins and interned at the American Academy in Rome.</p>
