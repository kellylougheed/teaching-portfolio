	<h1>Code + Creative Writing</h1>

	<p>This series of workshops, titled Be a Digital Fortune Teller, was originally offered to middle school girls. The workshops combined coding in the Python programming language with creative writing. Using programming elements such as variables, conditionals, and lists, students built a variety of creative projects, from personality quizzes to fortune tellers to Choose Your Own Adventure games.</p>

	<p>In each workshop, students learned a new coding skill and then applied it to making a text-based computer game. Students seemed to enjoy crafting stories and amusing their friends, and the activities provided great motivation for mastering coding concepts.</p>
