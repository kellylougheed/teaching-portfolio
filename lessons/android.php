	<h1>Android Fortune Teller Lab</h1>

	<p><img src="http://www.kellylougheed.com/teaching/images/magic8ball.gif" alt="Magic 8 Ball Android app" class="side" /></p>

	<p>This lab reinforces students' understanding of Java arrays and ArrayLists by having them use these data structures to build an Android fortune teller app. It was designed for an advanced Java class of 10th-12th graders.</p>

	<p>Beyond teaching students how to build mobile apps, the lab calls upon foundational Java data structures. Students first build a simple app using an array. Then, after learning ArrayLists, they build functionality for the user to add fortunes to the ArrayList.</p>

	<p>I integrated Android application development into my Java class to engage students with Java's relevance to their mobile phones. Before completing the Fortune Teller Lab, students had built apps to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, represent a pocket pet, and play Tic Tac Toe.</p>

	<p>On the left is a simple version of the fortune teller app using just an array.</p>

	<p>Below are lesson plans for teaching arrays and ArrayLists with Android labs.</p>
