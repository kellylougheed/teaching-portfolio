	<h1>Code + Architecture</h1>

	<p>
		In a semester-long Art + Code class, students used the JavaScript graphics library p5.js to make original interactive art and digital recreations of famous art, from modern art to <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/kellylougheed/sketches/rkugRQZuW" target="_blank">ancient Greek vase patterns</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		During the Artists &amp; Architecture unit, students got to explore world architecture and select different works of architecture to recreate and re-interpret through code.
	</p>

	<p>
		Below is the description of the project, followed by examples of student work.
	</p>

				This student took the recreation approach. She also included a JavaScript timeout that made the background color change from night to day.
