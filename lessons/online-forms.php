	<h1>Online Forms &amp; CS Ethics Lesson</h1>

	<p>This lesson revolves around the reading "Select One," the fourth chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technically-Wrong-Sexist-Algorithms-Threats/dp/0393634639/" target="_blank">Technically Wrong by Sara Wachter-Boettcher</a>. Using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://www.schoolreforminitiative.org/download/three-levels-of-text-protocol/?wpdmdl%3D12706%26refresh%3D5aee3638a1de71525560888%26open%3D1" target="_blank">Three Levels of Text Protocol</a>, students discuss how online forms can alienate people of certain races, genders, and marginalized groups. Then they find an online sign-up form and redesign it to be more inclusive.</p>

	<p>This lesson is designed for students with no computer science experience but can be adapted to any level of coding knowledge. Instead of drawing prototypes for online forms, students can code them out with HTML/JavaScript or more advanced GUI platforms such as JavaFX.</p>

	<p>Below is my lesson plan, which references <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wLHByYu_0DgYKlzdoMg-8vwKRh5DcsRtS5RKhD7NtvA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">these Google Slides</a> to project student instructions.</p>
